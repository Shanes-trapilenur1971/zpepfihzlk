Just got out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Antes del cuerpo, and let me tell you, my brain feels like someone threw it in a blender and hit the purée button. I’m trying to figure out what the hell just happened. Honestly, not sure if I loved it, or if I just want my two hours back. It was like one of those dreams where you're hanging out with your childhood dentist, but he's also your ex's pet tortoise. Totally confusing but you can't look away.

The whole 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 practically bathes in this pretentious artsy vibe, you know, like it's trying to whisper sweet nothings to a ghost in a graveyard. There's this one scene where a guy, maybe the protagonist??, looks at a dripping faucet and you’re stuck there 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 for, I swear, like 5 minutes. Is that supposed to be symbolic or did someone just lose the edit button? Who knows. Art I guess. But also, how do you make water seem so heavy?

I found myself sort of irritated and fascinated at the same time, like when you see a couple fighting in public. You shouldn’t be listening, but how can you not? There were moments that just sucker punched me with raw emotion, and others where I was nodding off because seriously, how long is this lingering close-up gonna last. Can we get a fast-forward button for theaters, please?  

> And then there was that soundtrack, oh my god, it felt like someone dropped a box of instruments down a flight of stairs and just hit record. I guess that’s one way to do it. Why have a coherent melody when you can have a cacophony, right? Still, somehow, it worked. In a chaotic kind of way. Maybe it’s genius. Or maybe it’s just chaotic. Like my life, but less coherent.

They toss you into this world that’s all raw and visceral but also deeply confusing, like your first day at a new job when you realize you don’t actually know what the job is. And the dialogue was sparse, which made it feel like the silence was living and breathing, like it was trying to tell you a secret it hadn’t figured out yet.

```csharp
int mysteryFunction(string scene)
{
    if (scene == dripping faucet)
        return 5; // minutes wasted?
    return 42; // or was it?
}
```

Even with all it's quirkiness, I can't just dismiss it. Maybe it's the kind of 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that gnaws at your thoughts for days, like a stubborn popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. If you're up for that brand of chaos, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or catch it somewhere. Just... don't go in expecting to leave unscathed.

Was it a wild ride or a slow burn? Honestly, my brain’s still trying to untangle that one. Maybe I just need a nap.
